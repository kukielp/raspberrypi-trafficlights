# raspberrypi-trafficlights

Basic Python code to run traffic light example.  Turn off your pi when plugging in electronics :)

![alt text](images/pi.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

Pin Layout:
- RED + of LED to GPIO 22
- AMBER + of LED to GPIO 23
- GREEN + of LED to GPIO 24
- SWITCH ( same side as the +'s on the LEDS ) to GPIO 17

Ground ( GPIO Pin 9 ) to rail

Resitors from rail to - side of LED's and switch ( note swtich is niether + or - just ensure the wires are on the oposite side )

Resisitors are 220 立 but 1000立 ( 1k立 ) would be just as good, perhaps a little dimmer what ever you have lying around is fine antull the resistance is too high and the LED wont turn on.

Parts list:
- 220立 resistor
- LED Diods
- Small Switch
- Breadboard
- Wires
